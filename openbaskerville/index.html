			<p>With the written word an absolute fundamental component of daily communication, typography and fonts are vital to providing aesthetic harmony and legibility to our textual works. There are thousands of fonts available, of which only a small number are useful or any good for setting vast quantities of text, and of which an even smaller number are available to be freely distributed and shared. This project aims to help close that hole, beginning with a Baskerville revival.</p>

			<h3 id="using-git">Using Git</h3>
			<p>Obtaining Git is easy, whether you&rsquo;re using <a href="http://github.com/guides/using-git-and-github-for-the-windows-for-newbies" title="GitHub.com &thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp; Guides: Using Git and Github for the Windows for newbies">Windows</a>, <a href="http://github.com/guides/get-git-on-mac" title="GitHub.com &thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp; Guides: Get git on Mac">Mac <abbr>OS X</abbr></a>, or flavours of Linux, using your favourite package manager. Once you have Git installed, sign up to GitHub. You&rsquo;ll want to fork my repository and clone it, making your changes. This allows you to make all the edits you desire and when you want to push the changes back up, you can send me a pull request for me to pull your changes up for merging. Let&rsquo;s revise:
			<ol>
				<li><a href="https://github.com/signup/free" title="GitHub free sign up page">Sign up to GitHub</a>.</li>
				<li>Fork <a href="http://github.com/klepas/open-baskerville/" title="Open Baskerville git repository on GitHub.com">my repository</a>&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;click on the <img style="display: inline; width: 62px; margin: 0;" width="62" height="18" src="http://github.com/images/modules/repos/fork_button.png" alt="fork" /> button.</li>
				<li>Clone the forked repository locally onto your computer (where <code>$USER</code> is your GitHub username):
					<pre>git clone git@github.com:$USER/open-baskerville.git</pre>
				</li>
				<li>Make your changes to the font files.</li>
				<li>Commit all your changes (commits all changed files). You&rsquo;ll also be prompted to add a commit message in your favourite 
				editor to let others know what changes you&rsquo;ve made.
					<pre>git commit -am </pre>
				</li>
				<li>Push to the forked repository&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;this would be your repository you forked from me, and here you&rsquo;ll 
				just want to upload your changes to your repository under your name on GitHub:
					<pre>git push</pre>
				</li>
				<li>Send me a pull request so I am notified of your changes and can choose to merge them in with the original repository. You can do this from your project&rsquo;s page on GitHub: simply click on the <img style="display: inline; width: 105px; margin: 0;" width="62" height="18" src="http://github.com/images/modules/repos/pull_request_button.png" alt="pull request" /> icon, fill in a brief note what glyphs you&rsquo;ve added or otherwise changes you&rsquo;ve made and who to send them to (in this case me, <em>Simon Pascal Klein</em> by the nick of <em>klepas</em>).</li>
				<li>Finally, to ensure you have the latest version of the font files, including any changes that I have pulled from you, 
				you&rsquo;ll want to update your branch regularly:
					<pre>git pull</pre>
				</li>
			</ol>

			<p>For historical specificity and correctness, and entertain typophiles, Open Baskerville is to be a revival of a Baskervillian &lsquo;clone&rsquo; by Isaac Moore, a punchcutter who worked for the type foundry of Joseph Fry in Bristol and later in London. It is believed that he did so because Baskerville had little financial success, never selling his types which were at their making considered vulgar in their stark contrast of the letter-shapes and &lsquo;damaging to the eyes&rsquo;. Further, no other printer had the technology to accurately print with the high-contrast, sharp hairline punches at the time anyway. Fry&rsquo;s Baskerville was created as a derivative of Baskerville that could be used with the less expensive papers, presses, and the inks that were common.</p>
			<p>Moore created a huge series of fonts in this style, complete with ornaments, a (subjectively weak) italic, and old-style figures for the text weights. The typeface was cut around 1766 and the original matrices still exist. They were purchased from the Fry foundry by Stephenson, Blake &amp; Co. in 1910 having already acquired the Fry foundry materials off the Sir Charles Reed foundry. The surviving punches and even original matrices are in the collection of the Type Museum, London and The Smithsonian National Museum of American History, though both inaccessible, the latter due to their location in a warehouse containing asbestos.</p>			
			<p>Sadly <em>only two</em> complete original specimens exist, both in libraries that are currently inaccessible. The first, a broadside specimen printed in Bristol in 1766 is currently housed at the Providence library and the second specimen is in the Royal Library in Stockholm. A copy of the 1766 specimen was reprinted in <a href="specimens/Updike-Printing-Types_1766-FryBaskerville-scan.png" title="A low-quality scan of the original 1766 specimen as it appears in Printing Types">Updike&rsquo;s Printing Types, figure 276</a> though obtaining a high-quality scan is desirable. A contact attempt was made at the Providence with no luck whereas the cost of having a Stockholm copy digitised is presumed to be around the <acronym title="US Dollar">USD</acronym> $100 mark&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;this is an option worth considering. There is a very large, multi-page specimen in the Library of Congress, but it only shows the &lsquo;<q>Quosque Tandem&hellip;</q>&rsquo; quote and it cannot be photographed. Stephenson, Blake are likely to have edited and extended the typeface, as there are subtle variations and differences in the 24-, (possibly 30-,) 36- and 48-point specimens that were made in 1913 and consequently most of the accessible specimens feature them. Below are featured two extracts from two separate scans of Stephenson, Blake specimens. They are both of the Stephenson, Blake Fry&rsquo;s Baskerville, which in some sizes was produced entirely from the original matrices. In the smaller sizes the letters with descenders were replaced with shorter descenders in the twentieth century when the baselines of of metal type were standardised. (These are cropped exports; &rarr; the full-sized version with u&amp;lc characters, additional ligatures and lining figures: <a href="specimens/stephenson-blake_original_scan.jpg" title="Download the first full-sized version of the Stephenson, Blake specimen scan of the export below">one</a> and <a href="specimens/frys_baskervilleoldface.jpg" title="Download the second full-sized version of the Stephenson, Blake specimen scan of the export below">two</a> respectively.)</p>

			<p>Morris Fuller Benton revived the Moore design for <acronym title="American Type Founders">ATF</acronym> and it first appears in <a href="http://levien.com/type/atf_1923/" title="The ATF 1923 specimen over at Raph Levien&rsquo;s site">the 1923 <acronym title="American Type Founders">ATF</acronym> specimen</a> (<a href="http://casper.ghostscript.com/~raph/tmp/hrant354.jpg" title="12pt ATF scan from 1923, also from Raph Levien">also note a 12pt scan from 1923</a>), as well as later again in <a href="specimens/1934-ATF_Baskerville.zip" title="Download a zipped archive of the 1934 ATF Baskerville specimen">the 1934 <acronym title="American Type Founders">ATF</acronym> specimen</a> and in <a href="http://levien.com/type/atf_1941/p020_sm.jpg" title="Download a scan of the 1941 ATF specimen from Raph Levien&rsquo;s site">the 1941 <acronym title="American Type Founders">ATF</acronym> specimen</a>. Interestingly Benton did not choose to use Moore&rsquo;s italic, instead opting for an italic which was in fact copied from the type of Richard Austin that English Monotype later made under the name of &lsquo;Bell&rsquo; and also very similar to &lsquo;Bulmer&rsquo;. So also up for discussion is the selection of an italic; Moore&rsquo;s italic has been received poorly and as just noted, even Benton choose to replace it. We may do the same, using or basing it off an existing italic or if we&rsquo;re feeling particularly fruity, draw our own.</p>
