                <p>I&rsquo;m Pascal, a standardista graphic, web and front-end designer, and a rampant &lsquo;typophile&rsquo;. I was born in Mainz, Germany&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;the birthplace of Gutenberg&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;and now work in Canberra as a freelance designer when not studying at the <a href="http://anu.edu.au/" title="ANU: Australian National University">Australian National University</a>. I&rsquo;m actively engaged in the Open Source community and local web industry, notably as one of the unorganisers to first bring <a href="http://barcamp.org/" title="BarCamp wiki homepage">BarCamp</a> to Canberra.</p>
                <p>I enjoy drinking in as much good type as I can and have been happily bending beziers since 2004.</p>
                <p class="note">I also love friendly email and a good con­ver­sa­tion over coffee. Feel free to <a href="mailto:klepas@klepas.org" title="Email Simon Pascal Klein">shoot me an email</a> if you have something on your mind.</p>

                <h4 id="work">Work</h4>
                <p>I am a freelance contract designer specialising in web-based mediums&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;in particular web applications and web typography. I design both small and large-scale websites, user interfaces, accompanying icons, and provide usability as well and accessibility assessments&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;for an overview, view <a href="#portfolio" title="Skip down to the portfolio preview">a preview of my portfolio</a>. 
</p>
                <p>I have extended a large range of services in the past as part of working as a sole designer for a web development and consultancy company. Now as a contractor I have refined the services I offer to better suit this style of work. I prefer to work with a dedicated team and would be interested in establishing a dedicated position as a web designer for website design or web application projects, and of course anything to do with web typography.</p>

                <p>Got an idea bubbling in your head? A site that perhaps needs to be constructed? An app that you would like to build? I have formulated <a href="/files/doc/klepas-client-worksheet.pdf" title="Download the client worksheet">a handy worksheet (<acronym title="Portable Document Format">PDF</acronym>)</a> with some questions about you, your aspirations as a company, and how best to reﬂect that in your new website or web app. It helps me establish a clearer understanding of your needs. After all design is a communication art&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;it is vital to understand what needs to be communicated.</p>

                <h3 id="colophon">Colophon</h3>
                <p><strong><em>kle&middot;pas</em></strong> serves as a personal platform to write about work, studies, typography, and whatever else happens to strike my fancy. It also functions as my <a href="#portfolio" title="Skip down to the portfolio preview">portfolio</a>.</p>
                <h4>Typography</h4>
                <p>The website is built on a base unit of 16, with eleven columns, each spanning 64 pixels with 16 pixel wide gutters, and 48 pixel wide left and right hand margins to hug the page giving a total width of 960 pixels, in absolute terms&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;the entire design is elastic (just try bumping up the font size).</p>
	           <p>The main body copy column is 544 pixels wide which accommodates for an average of around seventy characters or circa 14&ndash;18 words per line per line for the body (at a font size of 16 pixels). The body copy is set in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_%28typeface%29" title="Wikipedia (EN): Georgia typeface"><em>Georgia</em></a> as designed by Matthew Carter with heading hierarchies and figure captions set in Jos Buivenga&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.josbuivenga.demon.nl/museosans.html" title="Museo Sans&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;a [free] font from exljbris Font Foundry"><em>Museo Sans</em></a>.</p>
	           <h4>Inspiration</h4>
	           <p>Since discovering the inherent beauty that seems to emanate from &lsquo;plain&rsquo; type, and stumbling across the elegance that is <a href="http://jontangerine.com" title="Jon Tan&rsquo;s elegant website">Jon Tan&rsquo;s website</a>, I decided to rethink version 3 of this site. I fell in love with his type folly (see his header and my footer respectively) and wanted to bring the rustic yet clear grace of well-set type to the web. Naturally I drew heavily on various pieces from the print world, but again, Jon Tan, and then John Boardley of <a href="http://ilovetypography.com" title="I Love Typography.com!">I Love Typography.com</a> fame deserve mention in inspiring me in the shaping the visual aspect of this website.</p>
	           <p>The portfolio slider is a little bit of jQuery magic, using an adapted version of <a href="http://cssglobe.com/post/4004/easy-slider-15-the-easiest-jquery-plugin-for-sliding" title="CSS Globe article on EasySlider jQuery plugin">EasySlider.js</a>, which I owe thanks to <a href="http://kyd.com.au/" title="Ashley Kyd&rsquo;s web-card">Ashley Kyd</a> (he writes at <a href="http://kyd.com.au/" title="Ashley Kyf&rsquo;s blog">ash.ms</a>). Finally I should pass thanks onto <a href="http://tatey.com" title="Tate Johnson&rsquo;">Tate Johnson</a> for all the help with Jekyll.</p>
	           <h4>Technical scaffolding</h4>
	           <p>On the technical side the bread and butter that keeps pages and posts together is <a href="http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/tree/master" title="Jekyll on github.com">Jekyll</a>, a Ruby-based static site generator, allowing me to write articles in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" title="Markdown &lsquo;markup&rsquo;">Markdown</a>. The entire <a href="http://github.com/klepas/klepas.org/tree/master" title="klepas.org Jekyll source on github">source for this site</a> sits on GitHub, and is open for inspection.</p>
	           <p>Code-wise, the website is in valid, strict, and seman­tic <a rel="external" href="http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=referer"><acronym title="eXtensible Hyper Text Markup Language"><acronym title="eXtensivel HyperText Markup Language">xHTML</acronym></acronym></a> and styled with valid <a rel="external" href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/check/referer"><acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets"><acronym  title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS2.1</acronym></acronym></a> (it invalidates due to some minor use of <abbr>CSS3</abbr>). If you find broken links or any­thing else you believe is a genuine error please <a href="mailto:klepas@klepas.org" title="Email Simon Pascal Klein">let me know about it</a>.</p>
